# Primus Live

This is a simple development setup for Node.js apps, with minimal dependency
on other packages and maximal freedom to organise the app's source files:

* uses [Primus][P] to manage a WebSocket connection between server and client
* uses [node-static][N] to serve all static files in the `app/` folder
* can compile [Jade][J] (.jade) and [MarkDown][M] (.md) files to HMTL (.html)
* can compile [Stylus][S] (.styl) files to CSS (.css)
* can compile [CoffeeScript][C] (.coffee) files to JavaScript (.js)
* clients do not care about this, they just fetch .html, .css, and .js files
* the server tells each client to reload or refresh CSS when a file changes
* supports optional `services` module to include custom server-side logic
* automatic WebSocket reconnect with back-off (handled by Primus)

## Example

The example illustrates how to use this with frameworks such as [AngularJS][A]
and [Foundation CSS][F], and uses [Bower][B] to manage these code dependencies.
This uses Jade, but `app/index.html` would also work:

### app/index.jade

```
!!!
html(lang='en')
  head
    meta(charset='utf-8')
    style [ng-cloak] { display: none; }
    script(src='/primus/primus.js')
    script.
      ... // include angular and script loaders here for async loading
      $script([
        '/reload/reload.js',
        '/angular/angular.js',
        '/app.js',
      ], function() { angular.bootstrap(document, ['myApp']); });
    title ...
    link(rel='stylesheet',href='/normalize-css/normalize.css')
    link(rel='stylesheet',href='/bower-foundation-css/foundation.css')
    link(rel='stylesheet',href='/style.css')
  body(ng-cloak)
    ...
```

## Startup

Launch the server as follows and then go to <http://localhost:8080/>:

```
  cd example
  bower install
  node ../server.js
```

It will keep running, compiling (in memory) and serving files as needed. Touch
or change any of the files in the `app/` folder to see live-reload in action.

### primus.js

This transport-specific wrapper (here [engine.io][E]) is generated by Primus.

### reload.js

This script is also generated by the server (see `main.coffee`). It sets up a
WebSocket, initialises a global `primus` object, and prepares for live-reload.

## Plugins

If there is a `plugins` module in the current directory, it will be used to set
up Primus [plugins][G] - works for both server- and (simple) client-side hooks.

## Your own app

To customise, make a copy of the `example/` folder next to it and change things
there, so that updates of this code won't get in your way.

Load `primus.js` and then `reload.js` on each page to keep a WebSocket-based
bi-directional real-time connection open, and to implement live reload.
This is is particularly easy to do with single-page applications.

To disable live-reload, replace the `reload.js` script line with:

```html
<script>window.primus = new Primus();</script>
```

Live-reload is implemented by sending `true` or `false` over the WebSocket
(as JSON). These two values should be ignored in your own code when listening
for `data` events on the `primus` object.
