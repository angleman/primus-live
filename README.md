# Primus Live

This is a simple development setup for Node.js apps, with minimal dependency
on other packages and maximal freedom to organise the app's source files:

* uses [Primus][P] to manage a WebSocket connection between server and client
* automatic WebSocket reconnect with back-off (handled by Primus)
* uses [Connect][N] to serve all static files in the `app/` folder
* can compile [Jade][J] (.jade) and [MarkDown][M] (.md) files to HMTL (.html)
* can compile [Stylus][S] (.styl) files to CSS (.css)
* can compile [CoffeeScript][C] (.coffee) files to JavaScript (.js)
* clients do not care about this, they just fetch .html, .css, and .js files
* the server tells each client to reload HTML or refresh CSS when a file changes
* the server will restart _itself_ whenever a source code file changes
* scans for plugins to include custom server- and/or client-side logic
* auto-installs [npm][K] and [Bower][W] package dependencies in top-level folder

## Example

This minimal example connects and reports tick events from the server. This uses
Jade, Stylus, and CoffeeScript, but HTML, CSS, and JavaScript would also work:

### app/index.jade

```
!!!
html(lang='en')
  head
    meta(charset='utf-8')
    script(src='/primus/primus.js')
    script(src='/app.js')

    title Primus Live Example
    link(rel='stylesheet',href='/style.css')

  body
    p
      | Server time is: 
      span#tick ?
```

### app/style.styl

```stylus
body
  margin 50px
```

### app/app.coffee

```coffee
# make Primus object global for console debugging
window.primus = new Primus

primus.on 'data', (data) ->
  if typeof data is 'number'
    el = document.getElementById 'tick'
    el.innerHTML = new Date(data)
```

## Startup

Start the example server as follows and then go to <http://localhost:3333/>:

```
  npm install
  cd example
  node ..
```

It will keep running, compiling (in memory) and serving files as needed. Touch
or change any of the files in the `app/` folder to see live-reload in action.

### primus.js

This transport-specific wrapper (here [engine.io][E]) is generated by Primus.
It also includes the client-side code of all plugins, so they can be initialised
when the Primus connection object is created on the client.

## Plugins

If there are subfolders in './app', these will be used to define additional
plugins. Put server side code in a file named 'server.coffee' (or .js), and put
client-side code in a file called 'client.coffee' (or .js) and it automatically
gets picked up, i.e. launched on the server and/or sent and run on the clients.

The server-side code must export a single function taking 'app' and `primus` as
arguments - this will be called as part of the Primus initialisation sequence.

The client-side code can be anything, it is sent over and run as is (note that
this happens _before_ the client-side Primus instance gets created).

If there is a `package.json` file in the plugin folder, then all dependencies
will be installed in the top level before the live server starts running. If
a `bower.json` file is found, then those dependencies will get installed too.

Note that version numbers are not yet honoured, the latest version will be used.

## Your own app

To customise, make a copy of the `example/` folder next to it and change things
there, so that updates of this code won't get in your way. If you name your
folder "my-...", it will be ignored by git.

Load `primus.js` followed by a `new Primus();` on each page load to keep a
real-time bi-directional WebSocket connection open, including the automatic
live-reload. This is is particularly easy to do with single-page applications.

Live-reload is implemented by sending `true` or `false` over the WebSocket
(as JSON). These two values should be ignored in your own code when listening
for `data` events on the `primus` object.

### app/launch.{coffee,js}

If this file exists, it gets loaded just before the HTTP and Primus servers get
created. It should define a single function taking `app` as argument, and will
be called with the Connect `app` object. The `app.plugins` field has a list of
all the plugins - it can be adjusted or extended before Primus does its thing.

Set `app.port` to change the server port of the application (default is 3333).
